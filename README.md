# Pysimple-AI-chat

This is been a pasion project under the MIT licence, in it are two important files, a .py file containing the program, and a .exe file, which contains the finished program. Well finish in beta 1.0 but you get what I mean, to execute the code, simply run the exe file. as from the name, this program is a type of AI chat, right now it can only do text and desplay the raw output in a popup, but it will soon be able to copy and paste text output, and have prebilt templates for you conversation needs.
